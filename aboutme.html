      <p>
        Hello, my name is Fong and I am married with two kids. I a career I
        wanted to get into so I made the leap of faith and I moved from
        California to Rexburg. I stayed in Rexburg for about a year and moved to
        Idaho Falls. Then I moved From Idaho Falls to Utah. I am pursuing my AA
        majoring in Applied Technology. I love to watch movies on my spare time.
        I also love to play board games with my family ad friends. I have just
        recently move to Utah for an IT Support job. I love Brigham Young
        University because it provided me with an affordable online education.
        The reason why I am taking this course because it fulfill my major
        requirement. The advantage I see learning about web designing is that I
        can be as creative as I want to be. The possibility are endless. I can
        also help people I know build their website for them.
